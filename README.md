**An Instruction-Tuning Dataset for Unified Audio Understanding and Generation Across Speech, Music, and Sound**


Recent advancements in audio tokenization have significantly enhanced the integration of audio capabilities into large language models (LLMs). However, audio understanding and generation are often treated as distinct tasks, hindering the development of truly unified audio-language models. While instruction tuning has demonstrated remarkable success in improving generalization and zero-shot learning across text and vision, its application to audio remains largely unexplored. A major obstacle is the lack of comprehensive datasets that enable joint modeling. To address this, we introduce Audio-FLAN, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset covering 80 diverse tasks across speech, music, and sound domains, with over 100 million instances. Audio-FLAN lays the foundation for unified audio-language models capable of generalizing across a wide range of audio tasks in a zero-shot manner, much like how instruction-tuned models have advanced the fields of text and vision.
